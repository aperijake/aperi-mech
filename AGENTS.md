# Agent Guide

## Scope

- Applies to the entire repository.

## Environment

- In every new shell, activate the project venv before running commands: `source /Users/jake/projects/aperi-mech/venv/bin/activate`.

## Precedence

- System/Developer > User chat > deepest `AGENTS.md` > this file > other docs.

## Ambiguity

- If instructions conflict or are unclear, pause and ask the user.

## Indicator

- Prefix action messages with `AGENTS: ...` listing active `AGENTS.md` files; show on first action and when scope changes.
